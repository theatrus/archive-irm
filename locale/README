Making a New translation
--------------------------

Copy locale/po/irm.pot to locale/po/<lang_code>.po, and then edit that new
file appropriately.  Add a relevant entry to the array $supported_languages
at the top of include/i18n.php, providing an appropriate country code and
the correct encoding from the po file.

If you're getting the irm.pot from a released version of IRM, it won't be
the latest.  Contact irm-devel@lists.sf.net for info on where the most
up-to-date irm.pot can be obtained from.  Also, please subscribe to
irm-devel (http://lists.sf.net/mailman/listinfo/irm-devel) so you get
announcements of updated translations.

Tools for assisting translations include poedit, kbabel, and gtranslator. 
There is also a gettext mode in EMACS.

(Suggestions for good translator's howtos appreciated)
