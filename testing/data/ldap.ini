; LDAP authentication configuration.
;
; IRM is able to authenticate users by attempting a bind to an LDAP
; database, and to retrieve various pieces of information about the user
; from LDAP instead of from the IRM database.
;
; Note that any database for which a section is defined in this file will
; automatically use LDAP, and will not look for users in the IRM database.
;
; For each database for which you wish to allow this method of
; authenticating users, specify the database's 'id' (whatever's in the
; square brackets in database.ini) then give the necessary parameters as
; config items below that.
;
; Available config options are:
;   server: the hostname or IP address of the LDAP server to connect to.
;   rootdn: The DN (distinguished name) which is the root of your LDAP
;	directory.
;   fullnamefield: The field in the retrieved entry which contains the
;	real name (such as "Joe Bloggs").
;   emailfield: The field in the retrieved entry which contains the user's
;	e-mail address.
;   locationfield: The field in the retrieved entry which contains the
;	user's location.
;   phonefield: The field in the retrieved entry which contains the user's
;	contact phone number.
;
; All options taking a field name should have the field name specified in
; all-lowercase, even though many LDAP attribute names are mixed case.
;
; For example, to define an LDAP authentication method for the testing
; database, you could write something like the following:
;
; [testing]
; server = "ldap.host.com"
; rootdn = "o=host.com"
; fullnamefield = "gecos"
; emailfield = "mail"
; locationfield = "officelocation"
; phonefield = "officephonenumber"

[ldapusers]
server = "localhost:38389"
rootdn = "o=_irmtest"
fullnamefield = cn
emailfield = mail
locationfield = roomnumber
phonefield = telephonenumber
