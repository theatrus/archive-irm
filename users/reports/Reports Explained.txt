Additional Reports
- - - - - - - - -
All IP Addresses - List with Octet Mask - portlistoct3.php
This report is MUCH more complex.  It looks through the Computers and Networks 
tables and and grabs information. Because we use the Ports of Computer sto track
IP information, we ignore the IP field of the computer and network table. 
For network devices we have defined the id of "0" as the linking connection. 
Therefore any "0" ID in the ports section of the network device is also grabbed.
We have added an Octet filter because we have 1000's of IP addresses and this allows
us to narrow our searches using octet masks.

Computers IP Report - Sorted by Address - iplist2.php
This report is for computers only.  The IP info from the main computers table,
as well as the ports information associated with the computer is used.
It's a handy report if you are just looking for computer info. 
The list is sorted by the computers' IP addresses.

Computers IP Report - Sorted by Name - ipreport2.php
Same as the other Computers IP Report, expect this one is sorted by
system name.

Duplicate IP Addresses Report - dupiprep.php
A very handy report for tracking down duplicate IP addresses.  It first sorts
IP addresses by IP then compares them.  The report generated indicates which
systems are listed as having the same IP Address. As mentioned before, we use
the Ports section for all of our IP info.  This report will not work with the
IP field (but could be modified to do so.) 

Name List --- namelist.php
Pretty simple report. Simply grabs all the system names and spits them out 
in alphabetical order.  Their ID's indicate whether they are a network device
or a computer system.

Port Map Report - portmap.php
Ever wonder where all those wires go that are coming out of the 172 port switch?
Well that is why we wrote this report. Basically it takes all the connections and
tells you what they are connected to for any given network device. It displays the
actual port name instead of just giving the ID.

Racks Report - racks.php (and racks-report.php)
This one is very specific to our needs. This report will tell you all the systems
(computers and network devices) that are in any given location (we identify them
as racks). Therefore if you select Rack 192 you will see all of the systems in that
rack including their network information.
We also have an additional, very customized, section in this report that lists
system according to "groups".  That additional functionality is NOT included because
we store a system's group membership information in the "Other Serial Number" field.
Any text that you put in the Other Serial Number filed and enclose in parens ( ) will
generate a select in the groups drop down. This allows us to associate systems using
a free form system. I designed this after I discovered that the groups feature did not
cover network devices. 

Systems - systems.php
Simple system count that shows all the computers and network devices by type.  It also
shows the total number of network ports.



include/reports.inc.php (and users/reports-index.php)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
A special pair of $report_list entries in include/reports.inc.php, combined with
some added code in users/reports-index.php, provide the means of adding an
Additional Reports header on the IRM Reports page.
