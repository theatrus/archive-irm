We try and make upgrades as painless as possible, but there is still a
certain amount of pain and suffering involved.

If you're upgrading from a version of IRM prior to 1.4.0, see toward the
bottom of this file.

Before you upgrade
--------------------

Make a backup copy of your complete IRM installation tree, and make a dump
of the IRM database(s) using mysqldump.  This way, if our upgrade procedures
aren't perfect, you can revert easily enough.

In fact, it's better (for your sanity, at least) to upgrade in a non-live
directory *first*, and then once that part is working, switch the upgraded
directory to your active location.  This way, if there's a problem during
the upgrade, you have no downtime.

Generic Upgrading Process
----------------------------

* Make a spare copy of any non-config file you may have locally modified
	(local patches, layout changes, whatever).

* Untar or copy the latest version of IRM over the top of the current
	location.
	
* Visit admin.php using your web browser and select each of your databases
	for upgrade.

* If you're upgrading from a version prior to 1.5.0:

	+ copy config/database.ini.dist to config/database.ini, and restrict
	it's read permissions to your webserver user (for security);
	
	+ Modify config/database.ini to match the configuration parameters
	you need for your database(s);

	+ If you use LDAP, copy config/ldap.ini.dist to config/ldap.ini, and
	edit config/ldap.ini to match the LDAP parameters for your directory
	servers;

	+ Remove include/config.inc.php, as it is no longer needed;

	+ Install the PEAR MDB package either using the pear command (pear
	install -o mdb) or download it from
	http://pear.php.net/package/MDB/download and extract it somewhere in
	your include_path -- note, however, that manually installing MDB
	will require you to install several dependent packages by hand.  If
	you have root access, somewhere like /usr/share/php is usually a
	good idea, otherwise you can place MDB.php and the MDB directory in
	the root of your IRM installation.
	
* If you're upgrading from a version prior to 1.5.1:

	+ If you use LDAP, copy config/ldap.ini.dist to config/ldap.ini, and
	edit config/ldap.ini to match the LDAP parameters for your directory
	servers;

	+ Remove include/config.inc.php, as it is no longer needed.

* Manually reapply whatever changes you have locally made to your IRM
	installation (if any).  You can save yourself this hassle by
	submitting your changes for inclusion in the official releases of
	IRM.

* Visit admin.php (in the root of your IRM installtion) with your web
	browser and upgrade all of your databases to the latest version.

Upgrades from versions prior to 1.4.0
---------------------------------------

The new frontpage allows a guest user to easily look through the FAQ and to
enter a new work request.  This works perfectly under fresh installs (unless
you decide to change the password on the guest account), but will not
necessarily work if you are upgrading from an older version of IRM.  To get
the front page to work properly, make sure that there is a user named
"IRMConnect" with the password "irmconnect".

The software section of IRM underwent some major surgery for the 1.4.0
release.  Do NOT upgrade to the current version of IRM if you depend on the
data in your software tables, part of the upgrade process includes deleting
some of the information in the software tables.

For more help with either of these issues, please post to
