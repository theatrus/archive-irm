                         RELEASE NOTES FOR IRM 1.5.5
                        -----------------------------

What's new?
-------------

New Features:

* An enhanced and more user-friendly admin.php page;

* SNMP improvements (for those of you who use such things);

* Computer, network, and software lists are now all JavaScript-sorted (so
	they can be resorted on different fields on-the-fly);

* LDAP lookups can now be customised further using the usernamefield
	parameter;

* admin.php health check now includes a check to see if gettext() is
	available on your system;

* Database permission denied errors are now displayed on the screen
	immediately, so they can be noticed and fixed;

* Enhanced IP List report;

* You can now display a single users' tracking items via the tracking list;

* There is now an optional DHTML sidebar menu.  To use it, you must have the
	HTML_TreeMenu package installed from PEAR.


Bugs fixed:

* Several translation-related problems (buttons not working if using
	non-English languages, some strings not printing in the local
	language, etc);

* Fix User::FindUserDN so that it will hopefully work even on Really Crap
	LDAP implementations (Exchange 5.5, I'm looking at you!);

* Add a > to a search submit button so it actually works and exists;

* Port displays should now work better;

* Tracking item closed dates should now be as they should be, rather than
	the current date/time;

* Licence counts in cases where multiple licences were assigned to the one
	machine now display the correct available total;

* The user prefs page no longer prints "checked" all over the place;

* The system setup page remembers configuration items now;

* Fix "constraint violation" errors when adding computers and network
	devices.


Behind the scenes (primarily of interest to developers):

* An improved admin.php page, with bits split out into separate files and
	greatly cleaned up;

* Databases::Uninitialised() now uses IRMDB too;

* New Config::GetIncludePath() and Config::FileAvailable() methods to get
	the include_path as an array and to see if a given file exists in
	the include_path, respectively;

* Test runs now kinda work through a web browser (although there are lots of
	things that still need to be worked on to make it Really Right);

* Several files are now XHTML clean;

* CSS is being used heavily in several subsystems to make it easier to skin
	things.
