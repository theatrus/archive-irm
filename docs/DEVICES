Ok so here is the plan for getting devices developed into the system.

* Allow creation of device types (Done)
* Allow creation of device fields (Done)
* Create device entry form (Done)
* Field matching to allow existing dropdowns to be used. i.e. ram, location etc. (Done)
* Submission of device entry form (Done)
* Editing of device entries (Done)
* Deleting of device fields (Done)
* Deleting of device types (Done)
* Deleting of device entries (Done)
* Searching of devices from devices-index. (Done)
* Allow tracking to be linked to device (Done)
* Snmp to work if device has ipaddress field (Done)

The follow are nice to have but not nessecary

* Allow software to be linked to device
* Allow connections to be made between matching fields on different devices.
* Migrate computer type to device.
* Migrate network items to devices

Bloody annoyance whilst developing anything in IRM.

'computer' and 'computers' is seemingly used interchangable
'location' and 'locations' is seemingly used interchangable

This is a lie, 

the table for locations is called

dropdown_locations and is stored in the computer table as location.

In the tracking table the computer id is stored as computer whereas the table for computers
is called computers.

What this means is that it is difficult to call use sql calls based on names as you have to switch the plurality.
