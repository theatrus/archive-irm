Connector Fields for connecting computers and networking via ports.

networking_ports

This table holds all the port information for a device.

The device_type field will need to be changed from a tinyint(4) to a 
varchar(200) to allow device_type names to be used. The reason for this
is currently device type in the device table does not have an ID field, and if it 
did it would have to auto_increment from 3 onwards.


Currently device types are as follows
1 - Computer
2 - Networking

networking wire
ID is the id of the connection
end1 
end2

The two end fields hold the ID of networking ports that are being connected
